			<h2>C:\Users\sine_alis\about</h2>
			<p>I don’t like this kind of introduction because it is demanding and boring. I never liked to talk about
				myself. The
				“About Me” menu point was invented just for the egocentrics, but if you are still curious, dear Reader,
				feel free to
				read on.</p>
			<p>Until I was twenty, I didn't even know what tree JavaScript was growing on. But I wanted to learn
				something new and exacting. Programming in JavaScript was a big challenge for me.<br />
				As Socrates said: "All I know is that I know nothing." Anyone who learn programming languages, has
				experienced this feeling many times. But this profession is like that, because it is always evolving.
				That's why we have no choice but to learn. We don't have to worry about learning something new again.
				There is so much more to learn, e.g. Node.js, Express.js, Python and who knows what all comes next?</p>
			<p>That’s why I end my introduction with a famous Star Wars quote: "May the force be with us!"</p>
